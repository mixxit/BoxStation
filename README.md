# BoxStation
BoxStation Map for Stationeers (Fork of Bozak's Map)

# Source Material

Bozak's Map's layout appeared to follow VGStation 2018 BoxStation. So a reference I have been using commit 153eb485ad of VGStation13 on Github when placing items

# Differences

## Filtration

Although central scrubber and air pipes are in the same location as vgstation you may notice that the filtration units in Atmos are not running in serial. This is because chaining together filtration units causes huge pressure on the pipes between each filter and is recommended by the community to be run in parallel instead. You will still find the filtration units in the same positions as the source map

## Power

Where possible I have kept cable networks visible on the ss13 map as heavy cables. Any cables that would normally not be needed due to room power are replaced by normal cables

The central power network cable is labeled yellow which does not match the original source map

Solar networks feeding back to engineering were causing a short circuit due to the games 'unlimited power exploit protection'. To work around this i needed to feed power back from all solar arrays on a seperate network. You will see white heavy cables for this running back to the batteries in engineering

Where possible I have placed transformers in every room

Some monitoring sensors are chained on the main network to allow data feedback to atmos

## Fire Doors

You cannot place three fire doors next to each other so there are 2 blast doors and a wall between them
